           <div> <p>The challenges that I have faced, was that I come from a low income family so a lot of the times I couldn't do the sports or stuff that I wanted but I've strive hard to get where I am now because of working so hard along with my family. </p>
            <p>I never leave the house without my phone, ipad, apple watch or chargers. I just have to have them on me just incase no matter what.</p>
            <p>A random fear that I have of is people dressed up in costumes or people who dress up to personate people.</p>
            <p>My highschool superlative was most likely to go into the arts. Which did happen but it wasn't the performing arts that people thought it would be.</p>
            <p> Lastly, A random skill that I have learned how to make bread recently from scratch.
